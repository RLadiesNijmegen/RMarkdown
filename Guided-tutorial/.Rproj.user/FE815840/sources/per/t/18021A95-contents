## What will be covered during today's event: 

- the *Whys* and *Hows* of RMarkdown: general intro (5-10mins)
- guided tutorial (30mins)
- *Let's get dirty*: hand-on practice (45 mins)

# R Markdown intro
```{r Rmd_intro, out.width = "250px"}
knitr::include_graphics("RMarkdown.png") # I can insert a picture which is in the wd
```


## Intro: What is R Markdown?

* R Markdown is just a file format (.Rmd)
* It combines code (R) and text (Markdown)
* R Markdown documents are *dynamic*
* but can be *knitted* to HTML,PDF, Word and many more

## Intro: Why should I use R Markdown?

* Easiest way to a reproducible workflow
* No more copy-paste errors
* More readable than a normal R script

## Intro: How do I install R Markdown?

Run this line of code:
install.packages("rmarkdown")

Now you're all set to create your first .Rmd document!

## Intro: How do I create an R Markdown file?

It's really easy!

```{r new_Rmd, out.width = "650px"}
knitr::include_graphics("newRMD.png")
```

## Intro: the YAML header
![](YAML.png)


The metadata is contained within three dashes

Usually: author, title, output.
Optionally: bibliography.

NB: Indentation matters!!!

## Intro: Text

- [Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

```{r markdown_cheatsheet, out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("markdown.png")
```


## Intro: Code
Code can be included in two forms

* code chunks
* inline code

## Intro: Code chunks
```{r code_chunks, out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("code_chunks.png")
```

* In this document you can see the metadata and two code chunks.
* Code chunks are contained within three backticks (```).
* Inside {} you specify what language you want to use.
* Usually that is R, but it could by Python, Bash, etc.
* There you can name the code chunk and specify *options* for how you want your code to be run.

## Intro: Code chunks options
* eval: whether the code will be evaluated
* echo: whether the R code will be included in the output document
* include: whether the output of the code will be included in the output document
* cache: whether to cache a code chunk

## Intro: Inline code
You can add R code in your text with 'r ...'.
This code is always evaluated and replaced with the outcome.

## Intro: Output
* .pdf
* .docx
* .html
* slides (like these ones!)

* but you can also use R Markdown to create books, websites, and Shiny apps! 

# R Markdown Guided tutorial
```{r Rmd_GT, out.width = "250px"}
knitr::include_graphics("RMarkdown.png")
```


## Guided tutorial:
- R code chunks and inline R code
- Figures
- Tables
- References
- Compile/ Knit

## Guided tutorial: R code chunks (How)

to be able to run R code you need to include chunks that are R-specific.

Easy way of doing this:
- click on *Insert* -> *R*


## Guided tutorial: R code chunks (loading packages)

Let's give it a try! 

We start by loading the packages you will need for this tutorial.
We will need the following rpackages: ggplot2, dplyr, lme4, knitr and effects.

```{r packages & functions, include=FALSE}
#in your report, there will be things you don't want to be shown, like which packages you load.
#use include=FALSE to just run the code but not the output &/or code

#packages
library(ggplot2) #plots
library(dplyr) #tidying 
library(lme4) #mixed effect models
library(knitr) #for pretty tables
library(effects) #for plotting model output
#install.packages("kableExtra")
library(kableExtra)

## if ever you don't have a package, install it with a command like this
#install.packages('ggplot2')

## also load in a function to round and make prettier output for p-values
#reportP function
reportP <- function(pValue){
  if (pValue < 0.01){
    result <- "p<0.001"
  } else {
    result <- sprintf("p=%.3f", pValue) # inserts a float into a string and simultaneously do rounding
  }
  return(result)
}

```


## Guided tutorial: R code chunks (importing datasets)

Now that the packages have been loaded, we can move to the dataset we will use today.
This comes from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/) and.... 

it's about Titanic!!!

```{r markdown_Titanic, out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("Titanic.jpg")
```

```{r load data, include=FALSE}

#let's load the provided dataset Titanic which comes from Kaggle (different from the built-in one, in that it's been cleaned up)


#Titanic<-read.csv("D:/RMarkDownTutorial_RladiesNijmegen/Titanic.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
## LEB: this is what works for me:
## EZ: for me too -- let's encourage everyone to download the whole folder and use the R Project
Titanic<-read.csv("Titanic.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Let's move the features Survived, Pclass, Sex, Embarked to be factors
cols<-c("Survived","Pclass","Sex","Embarked") # I create a vector and the function behind will turn all the variables into factors
for (i in cols){
  Titanic[,i] <- as.factor(Titanic[,i])
}
```

## Guided tutorial: R code chunks (showing the data)

This is what the data Titanic looks like:

```{r str data, echo=FALSE}
#from this code chunk, we would like to see the output, but not the code, printed in the report.
#use echo=FALSE
str(Titanic)

```
## Guided tutorial: Figures (1)

Let's start having a look at the data.
We wanna visualize the relationship betweeen sex and survival.

"Women first!"

```{r sex, include=FALSE}
# First, let's look at the relationship between sex and survival
## use ggplot to make a summary bar plot
a<-ggplot(data = Titanic,aes(x=Sex,fill=Survived))+geom_bar()
#save plot
ggsave("Factor_Sex.png", plot = last_plot(), device = NULL, path = NULL,
  scale = 1, width = NA, height = NA, units = c("in", "cm", "mm"),
  dpi = 300, limitsize = TRUE)
```


```{r Titanic_Sex, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("Factor_Sex.png")
```

## Guided tutorial: Figures (2)

Now the relationship between social class and survival.

"All about class?"

```{r class, include=FALSE}
# Survival as a function of social class
b<-ggplot(data = Titanic,aes(x=Pclass,fill=Survived))+geom_bar()+scale_x_discrete("Social Class")
#save plot
ggsave("Factor_SocialClass.png", plot = last_plot(), device = NULL, path = NULL,
  scale = 1, width = NA, height = NA, units = c("in", "cm", "mm"),
  dpi = 300, limitsize = TRUE)
```

```{r Titanic_SocialClass, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("Factor_SocialClass.png")
```


## Guided tutorial: Figures (3)

Of course, we can also have a look at the relationship between class and sex over survival. Let's first simplify our y axis and make a new plot with proportions :)


```{r class & sex, include=FALSE}
# percentage of survivals per class and gender
## the as.numeric(as.character()) trick is used to get an average of the factor levels zero and 1, to end up with a proportion of 1 = survived values.
summary_data <- Titanic %>%
  group_by(Sex, Pclass) %>%
  summarise( percentages= mean(as.numeric(as.character(Survived))*100), sd=sd(as.numeric(as.character(Survived))*100))

# Survival as a function of sex and class:
c<-ggplot(data = summary_data,aes(x=Pclass, y=percentages, fill=Sex))+geom_bar(stat="identity",width=.8, position = "dodge") +scale_x_discrete("Social Class")
#save plot
ggsave("Factor_Sex_SocialClass.png", plot = last_plot(), device = NULL, path = NULL,
  scale = 1, width = NA, height = NA, units = c("in", "cm", "mm"),
  dpi = 300, limitsize = TRUE)
```

```{r Titanic_Sex_SocialClass, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("Factor_Sex_SocialClass.png")
```


## Guided tutorial: Tables 

In a typical academic paper/report, we can use two types of tables:

- descriptives (tokens, means, SDs...)
- stat model output (e.g., from a regression model)

## Guided tutorial: Tables (1)

Let's start with a descriptive table! Let's use this to describe the number of people on board informed by gender and class, and their age mean.


```{r age table}
## Sara: what about just doing the mean age by gender and class?

summary_data2 <- Titanic %>%
  group_by( Pclass, Sex) %>%
  summarise( "Survived %"= round(mean(as.numeric(as.character(Survived))*100),2),  
          TotalN=n(), "Mean Age"=round(mean(Age),2),  "SE Age"=round(sd(Age)/sqrt(TotalN),2) )
#table using kable() function
summary_data2 %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(font_size= 20)


```
## Guided tutorial: Tables (2)

Now the table we will create is a statistical model output. We test if survival was statistically predicted by Class and Sex of passengers.

 glm (Survived~Pclass*Sex, family="binomial", data=Titanic)

```{r model table, echo=FALSE}
#with echo=FALSE you only show the output

#set contrasts
## this is something we need to do for regressions with factor (=categorical) predictors
## we will use 2 types: treatment coding (compare effect to a baseline) and sum-to-zero coding (compare effect to averages)

#Pclass--> as treatment coding with 2class as baseline
contr2vs1<-c(1,0,0)
contr2vs3<-c(0,0,1)
contrasts(Titanic$Pclass)= cbind(contr2vs1,contr2vs3)

#Sex--> sum-to-zero coding, 0.5 F, -0.5 M
contrasts(Titanic$Sex)=c(0.5, -0.5)

#glm model
simple_model<-glm (Survived~Pclass*Sex, family="binomial", data=Titanic)
#summary(simple_model)

#table using kable() function

coefficients(summary(simple_model))%>% round(4)%>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 20)

#prepare for inline information
simple_model.table<- coef(summary(simple_model))
```

##Guided Tutorial: Inline R code & Figure

What we have seen from the model is that class really matters! 

1st class were more likely to survive than 2nd class (beta=`r simple_model.table[2,1]%>% round(2)` (`r simple_model.table[2,2]%>% round(2)`), z= `r simple_model.table[2,3]%>% round(2)`, `r reportP(simple_model.table[2,4])`).

Moreover, 2nd class were more likely to survive than 3rd class (beta=`r simple_model.table[3,1]%>% round(2)` (`r simple_model.table[3,2]%>% round(2)`), z= `r simple_model.table[3,3]%>% round(2)`, `r reportP(simple_model.table[3,4])`).

---
What about Sex?

In our baseline level(i.e. 2nd class), women were more likely to survive than men (beta=`r simple_model.table[4,1]%>% round(2)` (`r simple_model.table[4,2]%>% round(2)`), z= `r simple_model.table[4,3]%>% round(2)`, `r reportP(simple_model.table[4,4])`). 

The effect of sex does not differ when comparing 1st and 2nd class  (beta=`r simple_model.table[5,1]%>% round(2)` (`r simple_model.table[5,2]%>% round(2)`), z= `r simple_model.table[5,3]%>% round(2)`, `r reportP(simple_model.table[5,4])`), in both women have a similar advantage. 

The significant interaction with sex and the 2nd versus 3rd class contrast shows that in the lowest class, the sex difference diminished (beta=`r simple_model.table[6,1]%>% round(2)` (`r simple_model.table[6,2]%>% round(2)`), z= `r simple_model.table[6,3]%>% round(2)`, `r reportP(simple_model.table[6,4])`) . That is women have less priority.


## Guided Tutorial: Model Figure (1)

Easy to see here: 

```{r plot model, include=FALSE}

#plot with Effects
i<-effect("Pclass*Sex", simple_model)
i.df <- as.data.frame(i)
g <- ggplot(i.df,aes(x=Pclass,y=fit,color=(Sex),ymin=lower,ymax=upper)) + 
  geom_pointrange(position=position_dodge(width=.1)) + #geom_smooth(method="lm",se=T,size=1)+
  xlab("Social Class") + ylab("Survival") + ggtitle("Effect of Class, and Sex on Titanic Survival")
#save plot
ggsave("glm_results.png", plot = last_plot(), device = NULL, path = NULL,
  scale = 1, width = NA, height = NA, units = c("in", "cm", "mm"),
  dpi = 300, limitsize = TRUE)
```

```{r Titanic_Model, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("glm_results.png")
```
